# siy
A system for quickly creating data pipelines\

Siy means "si y", or Spanish for "yes and".  The basic philosoophy of this system is that data should be placed in a central lake, processed there, and the results returned to that same lake.  This allows modification and evolution of data pipelines over time, instead of having to constantly reconfigure and redevelop data pipelines that are used to feed MLP and other processes.
